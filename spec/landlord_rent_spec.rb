#Rspec ideas for the landlord page

#Create a new e-mail
#open the messaging service
#hit new message
#send the message
#should have a message history in the sent messages tab

#Adding a new tenant
#If a new tenant is added
#There should be changes to amount owed
#As well as a change to the amount of tenants

#Receiving a document
#If I add a new document to receive
#It should show up on the page itself
#And the number should increase

#Changing the rent
#If the rent is due
#The rent total should display the new amount
#Which should be the total of all the rents owed
