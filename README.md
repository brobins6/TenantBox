# TenantBox

This was a group assignment for Software engineering where me and my group where to work in a Agile environment.
We tasked ourselves each week using zenhub for personal assignments for the project.

The project was to create a website that can have landords communicate with their tennants for maintenace requests and email. The landlords 
would also have a list of all the tennants and the property they live at. 

What i accomplished in it was to work together with one of my classmates on the landlord side where i created the datatbase with the tennants
and enabled the landlord to sort through the tennants by name and others. I also made a table for the maintenance requests where the 
landlord can change the status of the report by just clicking on the cell of the table.

We also wrote testing for the code using rspect and cucumber.
The project was made in ruby on rails.
