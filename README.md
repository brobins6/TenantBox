# TenantBox

Group Project for Software Engineering Class.
My team and I were tasked to make a communication website between tenant and landlord. 
I was paired with one of my teamates to create the landlord side of the website while my other teamates 
worked on the tenant side of the site. 


* Programmed on Ruby on Rails with haml code
* Database was done using Postgres
* MVC structure
* agile development cycle

The features of the site:
```
- Tenant and landlord account
- database with all acounts
- database with maintanace forms
- able to log out of account 
- All code was tested using RSpec 
```

Tenant side:
```
- maintanace request forms and all existing ones 
- Communication threads between user and landlord
- billing address
- account profile
- home page that shows unread messages, and how much is rent, and when its due.
```

Landlord side:
```
- shows total balance due 
- Communication threads between user and landlord
- account profile
- all maintanace requests and able to change status 
- list of all tenants and able to sort through them
```
